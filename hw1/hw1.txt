This program takes n arrays of length m (3,4) of ints.
Func1 is a recursive function that changes the 0th
value in each array of ints, except for the 0th array.
For each other array, func2 is a helper function used
to add up all of the ints in the array before it.
The sum of the array before becomes the new 0th value.
